pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.

## Why pandas?

- Columns/Rows can and inserted or deleted
- Faster
- Can handle large datasets

## Difference between Category and Object
### Category
- A string variable consisting of only a few values
- A categorial data takes only a limited number of values 

### Object
- Columns with mixed data types(strings and numerical)
- Not fixed length
### NOTE:If a column had value "NaN" its a object
